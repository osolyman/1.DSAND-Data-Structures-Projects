Efficiency:
            Time Complexity is O(n * log n) where:

                    Building the tree of Huffman is combining the nodes repeatedly until we get the one tree of all nodes which is the highest time complexity.

            Space Complexity is O(u) where:

                    the space needed for each step like (calculating frequency, creating the heap, creating the tree and generating the code) is O(u)
