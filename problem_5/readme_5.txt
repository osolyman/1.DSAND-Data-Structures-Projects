Time Complexity:    'append_block' method, it could be O(n) because we traverse the Chain or Linkedlist
                    to add the new block

                    'display_blocks' method, it could be O(n) also like the appending method because we
                    traverse the entire chain to print every blocks information

Space Complexity:   the space of the chain is depending on the number of the blocks in it. Therefore,
                    the space could be O(n) in the worst case.
