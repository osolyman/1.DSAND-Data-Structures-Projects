Time Complexity:    in union function, it could be O(n+k) because we may iterarte throught two linkedlists
                    one would take O(n) and the other would take O(k)

                    in intersection function, it could be also O(n+k) because we may iterarte throught both
                    linkedlists.

Space Complexity:   in union function, it could be O(n+k), where n and k are the number of elements of each
                    linkedlist 

                    in intersection function, it could be O(n+k) also, where n and k are the number of 
                    elements of each linkedlist
